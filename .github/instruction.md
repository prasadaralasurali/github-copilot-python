# Project general coding standards

## CSS Style
- Keep CSS selectors as short and specific as possible
- Use CSS variables for consistent styling
- Avoid using !important
- Use flexbox or grid for layout instead of floats
- Use rem or em units for font sizes and spacing
- Use media queries for responsive design
- Use transitions for hover effects
- Use CSS modules for scoped styles
- Use a linter like ESLint to enforce CSS standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelcase for variables and functions
- Use index instead of idx for loop variables
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Errors should be handled gracefully with appropriate messages to the user.
- Include retry options where appropriate
